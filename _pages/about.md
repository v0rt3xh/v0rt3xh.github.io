Welcome to my personal page! 

My name is Haitao. At the moment, I'm working as a data engineer (or data analyst) for Vibe, Inc. I use this place to write some random posts. 

There was a more detailed introduction (outdated). You might find it in the commit history though. I will come up with a new one soon.
