Welcome to my personal page! 

My name is Haitao, a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ~~I will start to work as a data scientist at Indeed in April 2023~~ (Offer has been rescinded..). I have rich experience in statistical modeling and machine learning. I'm also interested in developing web applications. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, photography, stargazing, playing soccer, and video games. 

On my page, you can find a portfolio to my previous projects. At the moment, I'm updating a blog section. I will write some stuffs about recommender systems, home-cooked dishes recipes, and constellations (Quite random huh?).
