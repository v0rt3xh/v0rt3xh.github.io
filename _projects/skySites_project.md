There are tons of places around Madison for outdoor activities. You can view the sunset at Tennery Park, or have a look at the windy Wisconsin River at Ferry Bluff. But where are these places and when is the best time to visit?

        width="400"%}

To help people retrieve these information easily, I build a website called Madison Skysite. One can find the places for watching sunrises, sunsets, and night sky around Madison.

This project was based on an [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). Many thanks to Colt for his wonderful instructions, Cloudinary for the free cloud quota, visualcrossing for the weather API service, Heroku for hosting the application.

Before November 2022, you can access a web demo. However, now I no longer have the free-tier Heroku trial. You can only view the following screenshots taken from my local host.
